### Drafted Questions for the Last Two Coding Problems

#### **Question 1: Card Game Matching (Comparison of Discrete Values)**  
**Problem Statement**:  
You are given two sets of cards:
- **Set A** contains `N` cards, each with a number. 
- **Set B** contains `K` cards, each with a number.  

You must compare each card from **Set A** with the cards in **Set B** according to the following rules:  
1. If the card from **Set A** equals a special number `K`, print `1`.  
2. If the card from **Set A** matches any number in **Set B** but is **not equal** to `K`, print `0`.  
3. If the card from **Set A** does not match any number in **Set B**, print `#`.  

**Input Format**:
1. The first line contains two integers `N` (size of Set A) and `K` (the special number).  
2. The second line contains `N` space-separated integers representing the cards in **Set A**.  
3. The third line contains `K` space-separated integers representing the cards in **Set B**.  

**Output Format**:  
Print a sequence of numbers (`0`, `1`, and/or `#`) corresponding to the result of comparing each card in **Set A**.

**Sample Input**:
```
6 3
10 10 14 2 3 3
10 2 3
```

**Sample Output**:
```
00#011
```

**Explanation**:  
- Card `10`: Found in **Set B**, not `K` → `0`.  
- Card `10`: Found in **Set B**, not `K` → `0`.  
- Card `14`: Not in **Set B** → `#`.  
- Card `2`: Found in **Set B**, not `K` → `0`.  
- Card `3`: Equals `K` → `1`.  
- Card `3`: Equals `K` → `1`.

#### **Question 2: Tasty Dishes Combination Counting**  
**Problem Statement**:  
A chef has `N` ingredients available to prepare dishes.  
- For each ingredient `i`, the amount used must lie between `L[i]` (minimum) and `R[i]` (maximum).  
- A dish satisfies the person's appetite only if its **total weight** (sum of all ingredient amounts) lies between `A` (minimum weight) and `B` (maximum weight).  

Your task is to count all possible combinations of ingredient amounts that result in dishes satisfying these conditions.  

**Input Format**:  
1. The first line contains an integer `N` (number of ingredients).  
2. The next `N` lines contain two space-separated integers, `L[i]` and `R[i]` (range of ingredient amounts for the `i-th` ingredient).  
3. The last line contains two space-separated integers `A` and `B` (appetite range).  

**Output Format**:  
Print a single integer denoting the number of valid combinations of ingredient amounts.

**Constraints**:  
- All values in `L[i]`, `R[i]`, `A`, and `B` are natural numbers ≤ 100.  
- `N ≤ 10` to ensure computation is feasible.  

**Sample Input**:
```
2
4 5
2 5
7 9
```

**Sample Output**:
```
8
```

**Explanation**:  
- Possible combinations of ingredient amounts:  
  1. `(4, 3) → 7 (Valid)`
  2. `(4, 4) → 8 (Valid)`
  3. `(4, 5) → 9 (Valid)`
  4. `(5, 2) → 7 (Valid)`
  5. `(5, 3) → 8 (Valid)`
  6. `(5, 4) → 9 (Valid)`
  7. `(5, 5) → 10 (Invalid)`
  8. `(5, 5) → 10 (Invalid)`  
  Count of valid dishes: `8`.
